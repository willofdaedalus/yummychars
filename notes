8-bit colour codes are basically \033[{code}m where {code} is an integer for 
the colour code representing some colour e.g \033[30m paints the foreground of a
cell black and \033[31m paints the foreground of cell red

256-bit on the other is slightly different; \033[38;5;{code}m where again {code}
is an integer between 0 and 255 inclusive. that only paints the foreground of the
cell though
